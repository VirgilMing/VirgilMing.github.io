### About this blog

Welcome to Virgil's Wheel Workshop, my dev blog.

By “dev” I mean more than code. Engineering, design, typography, hardware of many kinds... As long as I find it worth noting in work, I'll write for it.

And “wheel” does mean that common jargon. We developers invent and reinvent wheels everyday, but not all wheels are nice ones. I try to make nice treatments, and hence “workshop.”

It will not be updated very frequently, as I try to maintain high quality standard. However I'll try to maintain at least one post a month.

To welcome visitors worldwide, I write this blog in English; though in posts about Chinese typography, expect Chinese texts.

Comments about posts are welcome via email (see below). I'll definitely reply to every useful feedback, and probably write a post about it.

### About me

Virgil Ming is a developer. No more, no less.

Since I do not have yet get my first job, and I withdrew from my bachelor course for personal reasons, there isn't really much for a CV. If I am open to hiring, I trust that my potential employer can judge through my posts, contributions and answers on the Internet.

And in case you're interested, I write [another blog]() (under construction now) about my life. Although here I write in English, that blog is mainly in Chinese, my proud mother tongue.
